<h1>Carbon accounting methodology</h1>

<p>This dashboard displays information about your organization's <a href="https://www.epa.gov/climateleadership/scope-1-and-scope-2-inventory-guidance" target="_blank">Scope 1 and Scope 2</a> greenhouse emissions.</p>

<p>Scope 1 emissions are produced from the direct burning of fossil fuels, such as the natural gas typically used to heat buildings. Scope 1 emissions are calculated by multiplying a standard factor by the total amount of fuel used.</p>

<p>Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions caused by the purchase of energy, most commonly in the form of electricity.</p>

<p>This dashboard uses the <a href="https://www.theclimateregistry.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Scope-2-FAQs.pdf" target="_blank">location-based method</a> for calculating Scope 2 emissions. The location-based method uses average emissions factors for your regional grid based on the  location of your electricity use. These factors are multiplied by your electricity use to determine total Scope 2 emissions. Emissions factors change over time, based on the mix of generation sources on your regional grid.</p>

<p>For electricity use in the United States and some neighboring regions in Mexico, we use the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/egrid" target="_blank">eGRID factors</a> published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and updated roughly annually.<p>

<p>For electricity use in other areas, we use factors published by <a href="https://www.theclimateregistry.org/" target="_blank">The Climate Registry</a>.</p>

<p>Emissions are reported in terms of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent (CO<sub>2</sub>e), a measure that converts greenhouse gasses into their equivalent amount of carbon dioxide based on relative <a href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/ghg-gwps" target="_blank">global warming potential</a>.</p>
